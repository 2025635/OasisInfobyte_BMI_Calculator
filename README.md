# OasisInfobyte_BMI_Calculator

the BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator with Tkinter GUI. This project aims to provide a user-friendly tool for individuals to assess their body mass index and gain insights into their weight status.

⚙️ How it Works:
Input Weight and Height: Users enter their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters) into the calculator.

Calculate BMI: The calculator computes BMI using the formula: BMI = Weight / (Height^2).

BMI Classification: Based on the calculated BMI, the tool categorizes individuals as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
